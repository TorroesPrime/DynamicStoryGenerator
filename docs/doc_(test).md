## test.py
This is a simple test segment of code that will import 2 characters from characters.py, and a ranged weapons from weapons.py, and run a series of test operations that can include:
1- Picking up a ranged weapon
2- conducting a ranged attack at the second character
3- conducting a melee attack.

And then generate a short story snippet based on those actions.
If character 1 is unable to pick up the ranged weapon, they are struck by an attack by the second character.
If the character is able to pick up the weapon, they will attempt to shoot the second character.
If the shooting attack is unsuccessful, they will conduct a melee attack against the second character.
If the melee attack fails, the simulation ends with a chidding by the first characters' commanding officer.

Following the conclusion of this test, the program will print out character sheets for both characters.
